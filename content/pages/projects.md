####Github

The best place to keep up to date with what I am working on is Github. It is not always the most organized collection of my projects, but it *is* a collection.

####Mediafiler

Mediafiler is a collection of scripts that allows for quick (and automatic) sorting of media files into a convenient directory structure. The resulting public link can be written to a log file.

I use this tool to help me post media files to my blog from anywhere I have access to Dropbox, mainly through my phone.

####Tweet Archiver

Tweet Archiver will automatically backup your tweets to a plain text file.  The user has complete control over the archive format and the archive file can be synced via Dropbox, allowing for quick and easy searching of all your previous tweets.
